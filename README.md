# sql-challenge

**This is my submission for Homework #9. **

There are two SQL files: employee_db_schema.sql and employee_db_queries.sql, as well as Entity_Relationship_Diagram picture. The data provided to populate the database are found in the data folder.

This project is divided into three sections: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

**Data Modeling**

I used www.quickdatabasediagrams.com as a tool to create an Entity Relationship Diagram. This diagram helped me create models of the database that I was to implement. I saved a screenshot of the final physical model named QuickDBD-export.

**Data Engineering**

The ERD design website allowed me to export my entity relationship diagram as a PostgreSQL schema to establish my database's structure. The schema is found in the employee_db_schema.sql file. Here I was able to use PostgreSQL to create the database from the schema, and to import the data from the CSV files.

**Data Analysis**

In my data analysis, I created queries and answered all 8 of the questions asked.

I used my TA's for help regarding the tables and importing the CSV files in correctly. I used classmates to help answer questions I had and borrowed code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37266095/descending-order-in-sql
